> Device:
IK controlled car.

> Describtion:
Pet project of projecting and building circuit design. This is a Hello World as IK controlled car that includes arduino uno board that controls servo motor and collector motor. The resulted device functionally presents a complete working complex of elements, but practically it's incapable of riding due to lack of carrying wheel fixation and weakness of the 3v collector motor.

Manufacturing is made in 4 steps provided in co-named folders that include some details of the process to make it easier to reproduce and/or explain.
